Jailbroken/Rooted devices can access your iOS' Keystore and Android's shared preferences/keystore in plain text, so it is necessary to add another layer of protection.

- **iOS:** it is implemented through [Access Control](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secaccesscontrol). Everytime the app wants to access the protected keychain item, a prompt by iOS will show up. Only after authentication success will return the requested item.

- **Android** it is implemented through [FingerprintManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager.html) + Keystore. Keystore has a function called `setUserAuthenticationRequired` which makes Keystore requires user authentication before getting value.

- **Windows:** it is implemented using [PasswordVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.security.credentials.passwordvault?view=winrt-19041). Only the App itself can access the data stored in its Password Vault.
